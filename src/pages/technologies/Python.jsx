        Python is one of the most dominant languages in the field of data science today because of its
        flexibility, ease of use in terms of syntax, open-source nature, and ability to handle, clean,
        manipulate, visualize, and analyze data. Python was essentially developed as a programming
        language. However, it offers a wide range of libraries, such as TensorFlow, Seaborn, etc., that
        are attractive for both programmers and data scientists alike. Moreover, there are various other
        tools connected to and built with the help of Python, such as Dask, SciPy, Cython, Matplotlib,
        and HPAT.
