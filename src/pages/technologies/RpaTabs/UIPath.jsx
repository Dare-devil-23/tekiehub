      UiPath is a robotic process automation platform for end-to-end high-scale
      automation. UiPath software offers solutions for enterprises to automate
      repetitive office tasks for rapid business transformation. It converts boring tasks
      into automation process using multiple tools. It was founded by Romanian
      entrepreneur Daniel Dines in the year 2005.
      More and more companies are adopting Digital day by day. With digitization,
      the biggest advantage is the speed of execution. But the challenge with
      digitization is that it requires diverse tools and hence manpower with diverse
      skillset is required to handle those tools. But workforce having varied skill set is
      scarce.

          We have many automation tools already in the market like Selenium,
          Waite. These software’s or frameworks generally perform best on web
          automation but fail miserably when you try to automate desktop
          applications or any remote applications etc.
